=== Public domain / unencumbered

Since we would still like to acknowledge all the useful contributions
from people who gave us public domain code, here's a list for
completeness sake:

data-structures.scm:

  Copyright (C) 1995 Mikael Djurfeldt
  Taken from SLIB (slightly adapted)

  SLIB's sort.scm has this statement:

  Richard A. O'Keefe (based on Prolog code by D.H.D.Warren)
  This code is in the public domain.

extras.scm:

  Copyright (c) 1991, Marc Feeley 
  Author: Marc Feeley (feeley@iro.umontreal.ca)
  Distribution restrictions: none
